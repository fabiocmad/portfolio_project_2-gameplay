## Initial Wireframes
Initial idea was to create a list of option of games for the user to choose from. Considering complexity of the project and deadline I had to adjust the idea accordingly and end up choosing a Rock, Paper ans Scissors game.

# Color Palette
Initially had chosen black, white and orange, and decided to change orange to lightSalmon along the way as its a soft color with less contrast and better visibility comparing to the others.
